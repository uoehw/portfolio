    <h4>
      In my free time, I love tinkering with personal coding projects, like this
      portfolio app I built, and I'm always diving into new frameworks –
      currently obsessed with Vues – because I thrive on the challenge of
      learning new things.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      I'm a bit of a design enthusiast, so I often find myself playing around
      with digital art and UI/UX concepts. And, let's be honest, I'm an artist
      at heart – It provides a relaxing outlet for the casual creation of unique
      and beautiful artwork.
